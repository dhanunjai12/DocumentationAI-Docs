# Tavily Search Crawler

Like any other search engine, Tavily Search has a crawler to discover new pages and index their content.

The Tavily Search crawler does not advertise a differentiated user agent because we must avoid discrimination from websites that allow only Google to crawl them. However, if a domain or page is not crawlable by Googlebot, then Tavily Search's bot will not crawl it either.

## Indexing and Delisting

<Callout kind="info">
  `robots.txt` is not used to prevent a page from being indexed. Instead, a site owner can delist a page by using the robots noindex directive.
</Callout>

Once your web page has been updated with this directive, Tavily needs to re-fetch it to apply the changes.

## Right to Be Forgotten

If your inquiry is about delisting web pages containing personal data about you, please follow the guidance and process of the right to be forgotten.
