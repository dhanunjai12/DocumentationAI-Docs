title: Rate Limits
description: Learn about Tavily's API rate limits for both development and production environments.
---

We offer two types of rate limits based on the environment associated with your API key.

<Card icon="key" href="https://app.tavily.com" title="Get your API key" horizontal>
  Create your Development or Production API keys.
</Card>

| Environment | Requests per minute (RPM) |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| `Development` | 100 |
| `Production` | 1,000 |

<Callout kind="tip">
  1. Access to production keys requires either an active **Paid Plan** or **PAYGO** enabled. More information can be found [here](/guides/api-credits).
  2. When using the REST API, ensure you include your API key in the header to apply the correct rate limits.
