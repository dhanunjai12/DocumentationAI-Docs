description: "Use Tavily from your Microsoft ADK agents for web search, extraction, and crawling."

## Overview

Use Tavily inside your Microsoft ADK agents to:

- Search the live web
- Extract key facts from pages
- Crawl sites for more complete context

The integration will work like other Tavily agent integrations:

1. Add an action in Microsoft ADK that calls the Tavily HTTP API.
2. Store your Tavily API key in a secure place (env var or secrets manager).
3. Send the user query and any options (like depth or topic) in the Tavily request.
4. Use Tavily’s answer and results to ground your agent’s final response.

  This is an early draft. We’ll add a full step-by-step guide and code samples once the official Microsoft ADK + Tavily integration is finalized.
