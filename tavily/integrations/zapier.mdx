- **Automated Email Generation**: Use Tavily to create tailored emails based on real-time data.

- **Automated Reporting**: Utilize Tavily's online search data to generate reports. Push this information into tools like **Google Sheets**, **Notion**, or **Slack** to create a weekly digest of industry trends or competitor analysis, keeping your team updated effortlessly.

## Detailed example - company research

We can build an automated workflow that executes brief company research for newly signed-up companies and delivers the report via Slack.

<Expandable title="Workflow Steps" default-open="false">
  1. **Trigger Event**: A new company is created in your CRM.
  2. **Conduct Company Search**: Use Tavily to perform a general search using the company's domain (provided by the CRM).
  3. **Retrieve Current Date**: Capture the current date and pass it to the LLM in the next step.
  4. **Generate Search Queries**: Request the LLM to create 3 concise search queries for Tavily to obtain additional information about the company (e.g., industry, ARR, CEO, CTO). Include the previously gathered data from the company website as context to prevent redundancy. Ask the LLM to incorporate important keywords related to the company to avoid retrieving information about a different company with the same name but in a different industry or domain.
  5. **Organize Queries**: Format the generated queries into separate fields for use in distinct steps.
  6. **Configure Queries**: Set up the 3 queries in Tavily across 3 individual steps.
  7. **Extract Structured Data**: Instruct the LLM to fill in specific details about the company from the gathered data and indicate the sources used for verification. Additionally, instruct the LLM to use the sources extracted from the domain as the ground truth.
  8. **Refine Information**: Format the information for clarity and professionalism.
  9. **Send to Slack**: Deliver the final message to Slack for easy access and sharing.
