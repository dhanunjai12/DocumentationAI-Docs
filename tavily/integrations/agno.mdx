Agno provides a lightweight library for building agents with memory, knowledge, tools, and reasoning, making it easy to incorporate real-time web search and data extraction into your AI applications.

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install agno tavily-python
```

### Step 2: Set Up API Keys

- **Tavily API Key**: [Get your Tavily API key here](https://app.tavily.com/home)

Set these as environment variables in your terminal or add them to your environment configuration file:

```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### Step 3: Initialize Agno Agent with Tavily Tools

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.tavily import TavilyTools
import os

# Initialize the agent with Tavily tools
agent = Agent(
    tools=[TavilyTools(
        search=True,                    # Enable search functionality
        max_tokens=8000,                # Increase max tokens for more detailed results
        search_depth="advanced",        # Use advanced search for comprehensive results
        format="markdown"               # Format results as markdown
    )],
    show_tool_calls=True
)
```

### Step 4: Example Use Cases

```python
# Example 1: Basic search with default parameters
agent.print_response("Latest developments in quantum computing", markdown=True)

# Example 2: Market research with multiple parameters
agent.print_response(
    "Analyze the competitive landscape of AI-powered customer service solutions in 2024, "
    "focusing on market leaders and emerging trends",
    markdown=True
)

# Example 3: Technical documentation search
agent.print_response(
    "Find the latest documentation and tutorials about Python async programming, "
    "focusing on asyncio and FastAPI",
    markdown=True
)

# Example 4: News aggregation
agent.print_response(
    "Gather the latest news about artificial intelligence from tech news websites "
    "published in the last week",
    markdown=True
)
```
