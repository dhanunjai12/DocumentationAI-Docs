## API Credits Costs

### Tavily Search

Your [search depth](/api-reference/endpoint/search#body-search-depth) determines the cost of your request.

- **Basic Search (`basic`):**
  Each request costs **1 API credit**.

- **Advanced Search (`advanced`):**
  Each request costs **2 API credits**.

### Tavily Extract

The number of successful URL extractions and your [extraction depth](/api-reference/endpoint/extract#body-extract-depth) determines the cost of your request. You never get charged if a URL extraction fails.

- **Basic Extract (`basic`):**
  Every 5 successful URL extractions cost **1 API credit**

- **Advanced Extract (`advanced`):**
  Every 5 successful URL extractions cost **2 API credits**

### Tavily Map

The number of pages mapped and whether or not natural-language [instructions](/api-reference/endpoint/map#instructions) are specified determines the cost of your request. You never get charged if a map request fails.

- **Regular Mapping:**
  Every 10 successful pages returned cost **1 API credit**

- **Map with (`instructions`):**
  Every 10 successful pages returned cost **2 API credits**

### Tavily Crawl

Tavily Crawl combines both mapping and extraction operations, so the cost is the sum of both:

- **Crawl Cost = Mapping Cost + Extraction Cost**

For example:

- If you crawl 10 pages with basic extraction depth, you'll be charged **1 credit for mapping** (10 pages) plus **2 credits for extraction** (10 successful extractions divided by 5) which equals **3 total credits**
- If you crawl 10 pages with advanced extraction depth, you'll be charged **1 credit for mapping** plus **4 credits for extraction** which equals **5 total credits**

## Plans & Billing

### Unlocking Production API Keys

<Steps>

<Step title="Select a paid monthly plan" icon="credit-card">
  
  Any paid plan immediately unlocks production-grade keys and removes test-only restrictions.

</Step>

<Step title="Or enable pay-as-you-go" icon="settings">
  
  If you prefer not to commit to a plan, you can enable usage-based billing to unlock production keys.

</Step>

</Steps>

### How Overage Billing Works

<Expandable title="What happens when I exceed my plan's credits?" default-open="false">

  
  When you use all credits included in your plan:

  - If **pay-as-you-go is enabled**, additional API calls continue seamlessly and are billed at $0.008 per credit.
  - If **pay-as-you-go is disabled**, API requests may fail once you exceed your plan quota. Enable usage-based billing to avoid interruptions.
