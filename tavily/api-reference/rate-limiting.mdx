## What is rate limiting?

Rate limiting is how Tavily makes sure the API stays fast and reliable for everyone. It simply means there is a safe maximum for how many requests you can send in a short time and how many credits you can use on your plan.

To see your exact limits, check:

If you are just starting out, you usually do not need to change anything. This page only matters once you see a rate limit error in your logs or app.

</Callout>

## How do you know you are rate limited?

When you hit a limit, the API:

- Returns an HTTP **4xx** status (most often **429** Too Many Requests).
- Returns a JSON error like:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "You have exceeded your current rate limit. Please retry later or reduce your request frequency."
  }
}
```

You may also see a `Retry-After` header that tells you how many seconds to wait before trying again.

## What to do when it happens

<Steps>

  <Step title="Pause before retrying" icon="pause-circle">

  When you get a 429 or other rate limit error, stop sending new requests for a short time.  
  If there is a `Retry-After` header, wait at least that many seconds.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Retry gently" icon="rotate-cw">

  After waiting, try the request again once.  
  If it succeeds, continue at a slower pace so you do not immediately hit the limit again.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Avoid tight retry loops" icon="alert-triangle">

  Do not hammer the API with fast retries.  
  If you keep getting 429 responses even after waiting, back off for longer or reduce how many requests you send.

  </Step>

</Steps>

Quick checklist:

- Wait a bit before retrying (follow `Retry-After` if present).
- Retry a small number of times, not in a tight loop.
- If this happens often, send fewer requests or upgrade your plan.

## Simple retry example

Here is a very simple JavaScript pattern that:

- Calls Tavily.
- If it sees a 429 response, waits, then tries again up to 3 times.

```javascript
async function callTavilyWithSimpleRetry(fetchFn, payload) {
  const maxRetries = 3
  const waitMs = 2000 // 2 seconds

  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    const res = await fetchFn(payload)

    if (res.ok) {
      return res
    }

    if (res.status === 429 && attempt < maxRetries) {
      // Rate limited: wait, then try again
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, waitMs))
      continue
    }

    // Some other error, or we ran out of retries
    throw new Error(`Request failed with status ${res.status}`)
  }
}
```

This is only one example. Use whatever retry approach fits your language and framework, keeping the same ideas: wait, retry gently, and avoid rapid loops.
