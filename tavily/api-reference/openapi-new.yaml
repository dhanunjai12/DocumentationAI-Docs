                  type: boolean
                  description: When `auto_parameters` is enabled, Tavily automatically configures search parameters based on your query's content and intent. You can still set other parameters manually, and your explicit values will override the automatic ones. The parameters `include_answer`, `include_raw_content`, and `max_results` must always be set manually, as they directly affect response size. Note:search_depth` may be automatically set to advanced when it's likely to improve results. This uses 2 API credits per request. To avoid the extra cost, you can explicitly set `search_depth` to `basic`. Currently in beta.
