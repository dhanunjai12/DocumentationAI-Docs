## Start searching with Tavily

Run your first Tavily Search in 4 lines of code. Simply replace the API key in this snippet with your own.

<CodeGroup tabs="Python,JavaScript,cURL">
```python
from tavily import TavilyClient

tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key="tvly-YOUR_API_KEY")
response = tavily_client.search("Who is Leo Messi?")

print(response)
```

```javascript
const { tavily } = require("@tavily/core");

const tvly = tavily({ apiKey: "tvly-YOUR_API_KEY" });
const response = await tvly.search("Who is Leo Messi?");

console.log(response);
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tavily.com/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tvly-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "Who is Leo Messi?"}'
```
