<Step title="2. Install Tavily" icon="download">

Choose your programming language and install our simple toolkit. Open your terminal or command prompt and run one of these commands.

<CodeGroup tabs="Python,JavaScript">

```bash
pip install tavily-python
```

```bash
npm i @tavily/core
```

</CodeGroup>

If you're using cURL, no install is needed—just a web browser or terminal.

</Step>

<Step title="3. Run your first search" icon="search">

Replace `tvly-YOUR_API_KEY` with your real key, then copy and paste the code below. This will search for "Who is Leo Messi?" and print the results. Run it in your Python file, JavaScript script, or terminal.

<CodeGroup tabs="Python,JavaScript,cURL">

```python
from tavily import TavilyClient

tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key="tvly-YOUR_API_KEY")
response = tavily_client.search("Who is Leo Messi?")

print(response)
```

```javascript
const { tavily } = require("@tavily/core");

const tvly = tavily({ apiKey: "tvly-YOUR_API_KEY" });
const response = await tvly.search("Who is Leo Messi?");

console.log(response);
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tavily.com/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tvly-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "Who is Leo Messi?"}'
```
