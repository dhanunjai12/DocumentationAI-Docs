## API Credits Costs

### Tavily Search

Your [search depth](/api-reference/endpoint/search#body-search-depth) determines the cost of your request.

- **Basic Search (****`basic`****):**
  Each request costs **1 API credit**.

- **Advanced Search (****`advanced`****):**
  Each request costs **2 API credits**.

### Tavily Extract

The number of successful URL extractions and your [extraction depth](/api-reference/endpoint/extract#body-extract-depth) determines the cost of your request. You never get charged if a URL extraction fails.

- **Basic Extract (****`basic`****):**
  Every 5 successful URL extractions cost **1 API credit**

- **Advanced Extract (****`advanced`****):**
  Every 5 successful URL extractions cost **2 API credits**

### Tavily Map

The number of pages mapped and whether or not natural-language [instructions](/api-reference/endpoint/map#instructions) are specified determines the cost of your request. You never get charged if a map request fails.

- **Regular Mapping:**
  Every 10 successful pages returned cost **1 API credit**

- **Map with (****`instructions`****):**
  Every 10 successful pages returned cost **2 API credits**

### Tavily Crawl

Tavily Crawl combines both mapping and extraction operations, so the cost is the sum of both:

- **Crawl Cost = Mapping Cost + Extraction Cost**

For example:

- If you crawl 10 pages with basic extraction depth, you'll be charged **1 credit for mapping** (10 pages) + **2 credits for extraction** (10 successful extractions รท 5) = **3 total credits**

- If you crawl 10 pages with advanced extraction depth, you'll be charged **1 credit for mapping** + **4 credits for extraction** = **5 total credits**
